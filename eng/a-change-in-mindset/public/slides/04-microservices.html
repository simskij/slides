As a reaction to this, among other things, the idea of microservices was born.

In contrast to the monolith, microservices are fine-grained, loosely coupled services organized around
business capabilities. Microservices communicate through simple light-weight protocols such as HTTP,
messages or events. Because of this, the microservice architecture doesn't impose any alignment between
services in terms of programming languages, peripheral software or hardware. 

For many of us, that felt as quite an improvement over the monolithic approach. Suddenly, we were able to
deploy independently, choose the language best suited to solve a problem or for that matter fully replace
parts of the solution without interfering with the oepration of anything else, as long as our public
interface or API remained intact.
 
Some of you, who have been around for a while, might still ask yourself what the difference is compared
to service-oriented architecture (SOA). There are two quite significant differences:

The first one is that the microservice architecture compared to SoA usually dont have a common application
or application service layer, but rather let each service or api keep their own isolated runtime context,
usually in some kind of container.

The second one, which I think most who've ever worked with SoA might agree with me on, is that it - luckily
enough - usually lacks any ESB. The ESB, or enterprise service bus, in SoA sort of served as a patch panel
between all our services, moving our tangled point to point dependencies into a black box where it no longer
was an eyesore for anyone looking at our solution from a holistic perspective.
