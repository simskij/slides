With that out of the way, let's make sure we're on the same page regarding what it is we're talking about.

When we talk about serverless, or at least when I talk about serverless, I dont mean it in a literal way,
as in: "there are no servers" but rather as in "i dont want to have to worry about the servers".

I'd also like to point out that to me, running serverless isn't necessarily equal to running everything as
functions. Functions is just *one form* of serverless, albeit probably the one that has gained the biggest
momentum in recent years. 
    
Simply put, serverless for me is a hosting option where I may host my application, website or engine without
even having to reflect over the server that is running it. I'd argue that Azure App Services, AWS FarGate and
Google App Engine all qualify as serverless, even though they're perfectly capable to run functions, microservices
and monolithic applications alike.
