## Concurrency

<aside class="notes">
If we look at the top three cloud providers, Azure, GCP and AWS, they all have limits on the concurrency of functions, which might be an issue depending on your use case.
Azure Functions have a limit of 200 instances per function, although each function may process more than one message or request at a time.

Google Cloud Functions have a hard limit of 1,000 functions per project and 100,000,000 function invocations per 100 seconds (~1,000,000 per second on avg) per region.

AWS have a limit of 1,000 concurrent lambda invocations per region, although this limit is increasable by contacting support.
To what amount, I don't know. Ask Zoran if he knows if he's there.

Usually, this is not a problem though. For most workloads, it's unlikely that you'll have more than a 1000 concurrent requests.
With that said, analyze your workload before moving forward and also assess your need for heavy concurrency.

If you suspect that this limit might become an issue for you, just move your workload to a microservice running in a managed container or pod of some kind.
