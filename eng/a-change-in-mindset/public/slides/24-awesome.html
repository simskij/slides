## Serverless is Awesome

<aside class="notes">
This talk might feel a bit on the negative side.

While writing this talk, I quickly realized that it might be interpreted as dislike or criticism against serverless computing.
I'd just like to take a moment to tell you that it's not. I truly believe that serverless is the natural progression of cloud based computing
and that we, as developers, should embrace the chance of not having to care about the underlying hardware or OS and instead fully focus
on the business value our organizations are set to deliver.

This is rather some 'think before you act' advice, which you of course should challenge while designing your own architecture.
If nothing else, then to make sure that you don't waste time exploring a rabbit hole that leads to nowhere.

Thank you for listening
