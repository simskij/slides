Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

This one has bitten me in the hiney more than once.

Composing services out of services, or services out of functions is sooo appealing at a glance.
For example, our purchase order lambda and our price calculation lambda really would make a great shopping microservice.

So, why is this such a bad idea?

For starters, the orchestration of such a solution quickly becomes really tedious.

Say for example that the order service, for each item in the order, should query the pricing service on the price.
How would this be done? One item at a time? All at once? How about if you also want to ask the address service about
where the items are to be shipped? And then want the pricing service to calculate the cost of shipping?
Would we then also need to ask the product service about the weight and dimensions of each item?

This usually also comes hand in hand with bad performance. The overhead of all the communication between the services
quickly becomes painful. We will also have to keep the client connected to our composite service or aggregator to be able
to return something useful to the user, which in turn might have a negative impact on our potential concurrency.

We also create a tight request-level coupling between the services as a change to any of the services our aggregate
depends on would result in the aggregate breaking.
