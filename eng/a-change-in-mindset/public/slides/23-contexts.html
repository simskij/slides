# Bounding Contexts

<aside class="notes">
So instead, to avoid this, we utilize a core concept from DDD called bounded context.
If we find ourself in a situation where we need to share business logic between services,
then we most likely either made a faulty design decision when we decided the boundary,
or bounded context, of the services or simply need another service.

Looking back at the silos, it's perfectly fine to actually build common services, utilized
in multiple workflows through messaging or event triggers, as long as we do it in a asynchronous,
decoupled fashion.
