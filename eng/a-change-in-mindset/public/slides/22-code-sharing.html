# Code Sharing

* Avoid libraries and code sharing between services as far as possible

<aside class="notes">
This is quite a difficult topic.

Most of us have been taught all through our studies and for the entirety of our time as professionals that code should be
kept DRY and that we should avoid duplication, almost to any cost.

For microservices, lambdas and serverless computing in general, I'd argue that it's quite different.
Code duplication is in many contexts, probably most, preferrable to introducing common libraries.

Why? Cause it introduces unnecessary coupling and dependencies. A change to the HTTP Request handling library suddenly
cascades through all our HTTP-enabled services, even though only one of them might be driving the need for that change.

You should of course still try to keep the code DRY inside your specific service, mind you, but across services?
That's a recipe for unnecessary downtime, deployment durations, and service quality degradation.

Looking back at scaling and concurrency, how on earth would we scale something that is shared between multiple services
through tight coupling? That would force us to scale each function or service, regardless of whether the rest of the
service would benefit from it.
