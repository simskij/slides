# The Strangler Pattern
<aside class="notes">
A big rewrite is seldom, if ever, the solution to anything.
And, in hindsight, the preferable solution is as simple as it's elegant.

Instead of the rewrite, we should have set up a router or load balancer, for example AWS own Application Load Balancer or Traefik.
Our next step should have been to take the whole application, without making a single modification, and move it into a virtual machine in the cloud.

After that, we'd be able to slice of layers of features one by one into serverless microservices or lambda functions, prioritized only
by their business value and by what frequency they need to change. If we at any point would decide to abandon our decoupling initiative,
we would be able to just leave it running without any additional cost or work needed.
