  Depending on the size and scope, it's not uncommon to feel fatigued after an experiment.
  Take a short walk, grab some fresh coffee or call your kids, cause we're not entirely done yet.

  Cause once the experiment is over, it's time to do a debrief, as part of measuring the outcome.
  This is, right after planning, one of the most important activities of the entire exercise,
  so make sure everyone that was part of the experiment participates on this as well. 

  I've shamelessly borrowed some kind of questionnaire from the Slack team that really resonates
  with me:

    - How long did it take for the error to be detected?
      Is that good enough? Can we speed this up somehow?

    - How long did it take until the system recovered?
      Same here. If it takes five minutes for a web server to recover after a failure has been
      detected, it's likely not good enough.

    - Did it affect any users?
      Depending on the answer to the previous question, this will more or less likely be the case.
      In what way and how can we be sure? Is there anything we can do make a 'yes' a 'no'?

    - Did the recovery require manual intervention?
      If so, be sure to document exactly what was done, when and why. Before running the
      experiment again, we should likely investigate whether these can be automated instead, and
      if not, make sure steps are documented and made available to the on-call team.
    
    - How can we improve our monitoring and documentation?
      Was the error visible in the monitoring? Is it described thoroughly in the documentation?
      What steps can we take to improve this?
