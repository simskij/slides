<aside class="notes">
  Let's start off by first talking a bit about what chaos engineering actually is.

  While it's really fun to think of chaos engineering as just breaking things for the sake of breaking
  them, that's not really what it's about. We don't just want to burn things because it's fun when they
  burn (ok, a little bit of that as well), but to make sure that all the effort we've put into making
  our systems stable actually work as we intended them to.

  The formal definition, taken directly from "The Principles of Chaos Engineering" is that:
  
  <!-- # ADVANCE SLIDE AND READ THE PARAGRAPH -->

  or, translated into less formal language:

  <!-- # ADVANCE SLIDE TWICE AND READ THE PARAGRAPH -->
