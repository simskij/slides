  So how does this work? Well, you, as the tester - or the scientist if you will - design an
  experiment based on a hypothesis. Utilising drivers, you then connect to your resources and
  inject different kinds of failure, probing the system to make sure the degradation stays within
  the bounds you've defined. 

  If you're able to perform all the actions you've defined as part of your experiment while
  still staying within your boundary, or error budget, the text is considered successful. If not,
  it's considered a fail.

  The results, regardless of the outcome, can then, using plugins, be sent to a service of your
  choice, for storage or producing notifications.
