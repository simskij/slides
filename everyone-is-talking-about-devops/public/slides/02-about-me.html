  My name is Simon Aronsson. I work at k6, where I help developers build resilient and robust systems
  through performance testing and chaos engineering. I'm organizing, or rather is supposed to organize,
  the Stockholm chapter of Ministry of Testing, but due to COVID we've not had a chance to hold any
  meetups yet.

  If you want to get in touch after this talk, you'll find me on twitter where my handle is @0x12b.
