Minimize blast radius
<aside class="notes">
  As with most devops practices, it's good to start small.

  Until you get the hang of what you're doing, you shouldn't get anywhere near a production
  environment. While the goal should be to do chaos engineering in production, a staging environment
  usually has enough similarities to serve as a dojo of sorts, where you can get started, practice
  and sharpen your skills.

  Causing a real outage and not having any idea on how to get it back to stable, or maybe even
  how to cancel the experiment could have devestating consequences to both revenue and morale.
  
  Keep this in mind, even as you start to progress towards bigger experiments in production.
  As chaos engineering practitioners, we need to ensure that the effects of our experiments are
  minimized and contained.

  This does in no way mean that we shouldn't be allowed to do experiments that have short-term
  negative impact, rather that the impact should be as small as it can possibly be while still
  allowing us to build confidence in our systems reliability.
