Test for the unknown unknowns
<aside class="notes">
  I really want to emphasise this:

  Unknown unknowns are really hard to prepare for, so simulating stormy weather conditions using
  real-world circumstances are most likely our best bet for exploring these territories.

  If we're already aware of critical weaknesses in our systems, we need to fix them first.
  There is no real point of testing for something we already know.  For instance, if we
  only have one database instance, then we already know that if it were to fail, we'd be
  totally screwed. We don't really need to design an experiment that brings the server down
  to understand that.
